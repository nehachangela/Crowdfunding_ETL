# Description

For this project, our team created an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular exprressions to transform the crowdfunding data provided to us. After cleaning and analyzing the data using Jupyter notebook, Panda dataframes, and python analyses, we explored the relationships of the tables and dataframes using an entity relationship diagram and created a database in postgresSQL.
